# Please follow the general troubleshooting steps first:

You may erase parts of this template not applicable to your Issue. Deleting
_all_ points is considered rude and may result in closing the issue as invalid.

- [ ] Have you read the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) document?
- [ ] Have you tested with a **fresh fork source checkout into a new directory
      with a full rebuild there**?
- [ ] If this was working before, do you know which one was the latest working
      revision?
- [ ] Does it also happen with latest
      [mainline (3.2)](https://github.com/harbour/core)?
- [ ] If this is an issue with a Cl\*pper legacy functionality, have you
      compared it against the original behavior of Cl\*pper itself?
- [ ] If this is an issue with mainline or a Cl\*pper incompatibility, have
      you reported this to
      [mainline](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/harbour-devel)
      already?
- [ ] Have you included the top of the output (lines starting with `!`) and the
      area where the issue occurred **first** from your `HB_BUILD_VERBOSE=yes`,
      STDOUT/STDERR (`make > log.txt 2>&1`) build output?

### Bug reports:

Please replace this section with a brief summary of your issue, including
self-contained example code, build output, platform/compiler and
version/revision details.

### Notes:

In case of inquiries, questions, usage issues and general or feature specific
discussion, please use available public forums. You can find popular ones in
the [README](../README.md#external-links).

Consider creating a [Pull Request](https://github.com/vszakats/hb/pulls)
to address any problem found. This is in particular welcome or even expected
for issues falling outside the focus of this fork, e.g. any C compiler except
mingw/gcc/clang or certain, non-priority or deprecated components (e.g.
Windows CE, older MSVC versions, `hbtip`, `rddads`, `gtwvg`/`gtwvw`, `xhb`,
legacy operating systems) and feature requests in general.

Please note that this fork only accepts additional code if such code cannot
(or is impractical to) be implemented as 3rd party library/utility. It means
that for code that uses documented Harbour APIs and can be built (or can be
made to build) as a separate component, it's recommended to maintain it
separately and make it available for Harbour users by providing a standard
(contrib-like) project structure and the necessary `.hbp` and `.hbc` files.
