# How to Get Involved

- You can give feedback/suggestions by submitting an [issue](https://github.com/vszakats/hb/issues/new).
- Submit a patch:
  1. Fork the repository
  2. Create a branch: `git switch -c mypatch`
     or `git checkout -b mypatch` (for Git 2.22.x and earlier)
  3. Do commit pre-check and new log entry: `hbrun bin/commit`
  4. Commit your changes: `git commit -am "Add this feature to that module"`
  5. Push to the branch: `git push origin mypatch`
  6. Open a Pull Request
- Make sure to use the same coding/formatting style as you find in the files
  you're updating. The easiest way to achieve this is to use these commands
  to format the sources (use this with care - most sources are well-formatted,
  so make sure to only apply it to newly added or updated code sections)

        $ uncrustify -c <harbour-dir>/bin/harbour.ucf <source{.c|.h}>
        $ <harbour-dir>/bin/hbformat <source{.prg|.hb|.ch}>

- Text editor setting for Harbour files
  - Encoding is either 7-bit ASCII or [UTF-8](https://utf8everywhere.org/),
    without [BOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark)
  - Use spaces (U+0020), never tabs or non-breaking spaces
  - Remove trailing spaces from lines
  - Keep one (not zero or multiple) newline at the end of file
  - Use platform native newline (CRLF or LF)
- In the rare case you need to send something large (> 100 kB), use this
  [free service](https://transfer.sh/).

# Troubleshooting

Evaluate these points before reporting an issue:

1.  <a name="trbl-1"></a> Make sure to have carefully read this document.
2.  <a name="trbl-2"></a> Make sure to do a `make clean` before doing
    a build after refreshing the sources.
3.  <a name="trbl-3"></a> If that still fails, make sure to install fresh
    source tree in a new local directory and start over. See
    [How to Get](../README.md#how-to-get) for instructions to get the source.
    In case you installed Harbour into system locations (this used to be the
    case with some \*nix users, albeit mostly unnecessarily or wrongly - e.g.
    for unstable versions), you will need to remember cleaning off Harbour
    from these locations, too.
    Hint: Never install unstable Harbour versions to system locations.
4.  <a name="trbl-4"></a> If you are doing a cross-build, make sure to have
    rebuilt the native Harbour executables for your host platform.
    See `HB_HOST_BIN` build messages to find their location.
5.  <a name="trbl-5"></a> Keep your `PATH` clean from old, mixed compiler
    tools or other Harbour versions when building Harbour. The surest way
    to achieve this is to leave only the C compiler directory in `PATH`:

        set PATH=C:\<c-compiler-bin-dir>

    > If you use Harbour official binary distro on Windows, even above is
    > unnecessary, so avoid it.
6.  <a name="trbl-6"></a> Remove all old, unnecessary environment variables
    (for both Harbour and C compiler) from your environment. Also remove
    any custom settings for your C compiler.
    Use only those documented in this file.
7.  <a name="trbl-7"></a> Remove any Harbour build settings documented in
    [Build Options](../README.md#build-options).
8.  <a name="trbl-8"></a> Do no or only minor updates at once to the examples
    included in [Build Examples](../README.md#build-examples).
    If it doesn't work, fall back to documented examples _as is_.
9.  <a name="trbl-9"></a> If everything fails and you are to report a build
    problem to Harbour developers, make sure to include your OS
    version/language/CPU architecture, Harbour revision, C compiler
    name/release and version, environment variables and verbose log output
    containing **both STDERR and STDOUT in one combined stream**
    (use `make > log.txt 2>&1`). Enable verbose mode using
    `HB_BUILD_VERBOSE=yes` and _do not_ enable multi-threaded (parallel) build.
    Configure your tools to output English language messages using `HB_LANG=en`
    and `LANG=en_GB.UTF-8`.
    Complete log output is rarely necessary, but make sure to include the top
    of the output (lines starting with `!`) and the area where problematic
    behavior occurred _first_. Make sure to not only include a link failure or
    a make tool failure, as it's most often not enough information. Compress
    your log using zip if it is larger than 25 kB (use the extension `.zip`).
    With these, you have much better chance to get useful or any response.
10. <a name="trbl-10"></a> Do not alter the directory layout and files in
    Harbour and 3rd party packages and tools (including C compilers).
11. <a name="trbl-11"></a> If you are to report a build problem with
    a Harbour application, all the above points apply, plus make sure
    to use `hbmk2` with the `-trace` command-line option and redirect its
    output to a file (see above how). Also include your full command-line
    and any referenced build script in your report.
    It is good idea to first remove all manual references to Harbour
    core components from make-files and custom environment. E.g. it's
    common mistake to add C compiler header and/or lib dirs, Harbour core
    header and/or lib dirs, built-in constants to make-files or environment.
    No such thing is necessary as these are automatically handled by `hbmk2`.
    In other words: start simple and don't be over-busy with *fine-tuning*
    your configuration. If you need to, the problem is most probably
    elsewhere. It's also good idea to try with the latest Harbour revision or
    Harbour's mainline branch first.
12. <a name="trbl-12"></a> If you are to report a problem with Harbour itself,
    include self-contained, minimal source code example. Do not use `xhb`
    contrib library (including `hbcompat.ch`), nor any 3rd party Harbour
    libraries.
    The example should reproduce the problem using the latest Harbour revision
    (with _no_ local commits or pending local updates) at the time of the
    report. Do not post links to executables and other binary files. If
    your source contains non-ASCII and non-UTF-8 national, accented, special
    chars, make sure to mark the codepage/encoding used and use
    `Chr()`/`hb_BCode()` calls to form the strings. Use UTF-8 if possible.
    Notice that core developers are likely to run code examples as `hbrun`
    scripts for testing, so it's a good idea to make them work this way.<br>
    Also make sure not to report multiple issues under a single
    GitHub Issue.<br>

13. <a name="trbl-13"></a> Please do not report warnings or bugs &mdash; except
    _build errors_ &mdash; in 3rd party components hosted inside the Harbour
    source tree. You can recognize these by their source path, which always
    contain a subdirectory named `/3rd/`. Report these directly to the
    maintainer of the respective component instead.
14. <a name="trbl-14"></a> If your example or report contains human readable
    text, use English only.
15. <a name="trbl-15"></a> If your example involves compatibility components,
    make sure to test it against original implementation (e.g. legacy Cl\*pper
    core language elements against real CA-Cl\*pper 5.2e or 5.3b, or `hbct`
    functions against CT3 library, etc.)
    Notice that Harbour is Cl\*pper Summer '87 compatible exactly as
    much as Cl\*pper 5.2e/5.3b is, meaning: almost, but not completely.
    For tests with Cl\*pper, use this free, open-source
    [MS-DOS emulator](https://www.vdos.info/) (requires Windows/Wine).
